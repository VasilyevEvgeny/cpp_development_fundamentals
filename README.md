# [Coursera specialization "C++ development fundamentals"](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/c-plus-plus-modern-development) by MIPT & Yandex

### About this Specialization
In the specialization, teachers share their many years of experience in creating large projects in C ++. They do not retell the textbook, but teach how to solve problems that most developers face in practice. Lectures, delivered in an easy and accessible manner, are supported by a large number of programming problems. After completing this specialization, you will not only be able to reason about C ++ by comparing it to other languages, but you will also gain real programming skills.

### Applied Learning Project
At the end of each course, you are presented with a large problem, for the solution of which you need to apply the material from all previous weeks. It allows you to comprehensively apply the skills that you learn individually in the lessons of the course. The final projects are based on real practical problems that the authors of the specialization had to solve.
